nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Proper authentication via NextAuth.js with session validation
      ✅ Role-based authorization (Admin + Assigned Operations/Training/QC_Manager)
      ✅ Backend validation prevents unauthorized status changes
      ✅ State machine validation on both frontend (UX) and backend (security)
      ✅ Input validation using Zod schema
      ✅ No SQL injection risk (Prisma ORM with parameterized queries)
      ✅ Clear error messages without exposing sensitive information

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Efficient state machine lookup using Record<JobStatus, JobStatus[]>
      ✅ Frontend optimization with useMemo for filtered options
      ✅ useCallback for authorization checks to prevent re-renders
      ✅ Minimal database queries (single fetch for authorization check)
      ✅ No N+1 query issues
      ⚠️ Note: JobStatusDropdown triggers full page reload (window.location.reload())
         This is acceptable for MVP but consider optimistic updates in future

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
      ✅ Clear error messages for users (Thai language)
      ✅ Validation at multiple layers (client, API, service)
      ✅ Terminal state protection (COMPLETED, CANCELLED cannot transition)
      ✅ Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
      ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
      ✅ 106 tests covering edge cases and error scenarios

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Clean separation of concerns (utility, API, components)
      ✅ Well-documented code with JSDoc comments in Thai and English
      ✅ TypeScript throughout ensures type safety
      ✅ Reusable state machine utility for both frontend and backend
      ✅ Consistent naming conventions
      ✅ Single source of truth for status transitions
      ✅ Easy to extend state machine by modifying STATUS_TRANSITIONS map

  summary: |
    Story 2.6 demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with production-ready quality.

    Key achievements:
    • Robust state machine logic prevents invalid transitions
    • Comprehensive authorization ensures security
    • 106 tests provide confidence in correctness
    • Clean architecture enables future extensibility
    • User-friendly error messages in Thai language

    The implementation builds appropriately on Story 2.4 foundation, reusing existing
    components while adding new capabilities. Code is maintainable, well-tested, and follows
    established patterns. No blocking issues identified.

    Recommended for immediate deployment to production. Future enhancements (optimistic updates,
    audit logs) can be addressed in subsequent iterations without impacting current quality.
