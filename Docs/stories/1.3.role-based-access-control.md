# Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** Admin,
**I want** the system to recognize different user roles (Admin, Operations Team, Manager),
**so that** we can control access to different features based on job responsibilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User model in the database is updated to include a role field.
2. The login process correctly assigns the user's role to their session.
3. A basic access control mechanism is implemented (e.g., a higher-order component or middleware) that checks the user's role.
4. As a proof of concept, a simple admin-only page is created and is only accessible by users with the 'ADMIN' role.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update User model and session management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Verify User model role field in Prisma schema matches requirements
  - [x] Update NextAuth.js session callback to include user role in JWT token

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**[Source: Story 1.2 completion]**
- NextAuth.js v5 authentication system fully implemented and configured
- User model with role field (ADMIN, OPERATIONS, MANAGER) already established in Prisma schema
- JWT token authentication working with secure session management
- Login flow established with dashboard redirect functionality
- Database connection and user authentication services ready

### Data Models & Authorization Context
**[Source: docs/Data Models.md, Story 1.2 implementation]**
- **User Model Structure** (already implemented):
  - id: String (UUID) - Primary Key
  - name: String - User display name
  - email: String - Login email (Unique)
  - password: String - Hashed password using bcrypt
  - role: Enum (ADMIN, OPERATIONS, MANAGER) - User role for authorization
  - createdAt: DateTime - Account creation timestamp
- **Role Definitions**:
  - ADMIN: Full system access, user management, configuration
  - OPERATIONS: Job management, customer data, task execution
  - MANAGER: Overview access, reporting, quality control
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres with Prisma ORM for type-safe role queries

### Authentication & Session Architecture
**[Source: docs/Implementation, Security, and Standards.md, Story 1.2]**
- **NextAuth.js v5**: Handles authentication with JWT session management
- **Session Enhancement Needed**: Include role information in JWT token payload
- **Security Requirements**:
  - Role-based authorization checks at API endpoints
  - Frontend role validation for component rendering
  - Middleware protection for route-level access control
  - Secure role information in session without exposure

### Access Control Patterns
**[Source: docs/Implementation, Security, and Standards.md]**
- **API Protection**: Middleware checks user role before endpoint access
- **Frontend Protection**: Higher-order components for role-based rendering
- **Route Protection**: Next.js middleware for page-level access control
- **Component-Level**: Conditional rendering based on user role
- **Repository Pattern**: Role-based data access through Service Layer

### File Locations for New Code
**[Source: docs/Source Tree Structure.md, Story 1.2 setup]**
- **Admin Page**: apps/crm-app/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx
- **Access Control Middleware**: apps/crm-app/middleware.ts
- **Role HOC**: apps/crm-app/components/shared/withRole.tsx
- **Role Hook**: apps/crm-app/lib/hooks/useRole.ts
- **Auth Utilities**: apps/crm-app/lib/utils/auth.ts
- **Updated Auth Config**: apps/crm-app/auth.ts (session callback enhancement)
- **Type Definitions**: packages/types/index.ts (session and role types)
- **Access Denied Page**: apps/crm-app/app/(dashboard)/unauthorized/page.tsx

### Component Architecture & Patterns
**[Source: docs/Source Tree Structure.md, docs/tech-stack.md]**
- **Higher-Order Component Pattern**: withRole(Component, requiredRoles)
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: useRole() for role checking in components
- **Middleware Pattern**: Next.js 13+ middleware for route protection
- **Conditional Rendering**: Role-based UI element visibility
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts

### NextAuth.js Integration Requirements
**[Source: Story 1.2 implementation, docs/tech-stack.md]**
- **Session Callback**: Enhance to include role from database user lookup
- **JWT Callback**: Include role information in token payload
- **Session Type**: Extend NextAuth session type to include role property
- **Middleware Integration**: Access session role for route protection
- **TypeScript Types**: Proper typing for role-enhanced sessions

### Technical Constraints
**[Source: docs/tech-stack.md, docs/Implementation, Security, and Standards.md]**
- NextAuth.js version: v5 for authentication framework (already implemented)
- TypeScript mandatory for all role-based access control code
- Follow Repository Pattern for role-based data access
- Environment variables: Use existing NEXTAUTH_SECRET, DATABASE_URL
- Security: No role information in client-side logs or exposed tokens

### Testing

**[Source: docs/Implementation, Security, and Standards.md#testing-strategy]**
- **Test File Locations**: apps/crm-app/__tests__/auth/ for role-based access tests
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for role-based component testing
- **Backend Testing**: Vitest for middleware and API endpoint protection testing
- **Integration Testing**: Complete role-based access flow from login to protected resources
- **Security Testing**: Verify role bypass attempts are properly blocked
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Admin role accessing admin-only page (should succeed)
  - Operations role attempting admin page access (should be denied)
  - Unauthorized users attempting protected routes
  - Role-based component rendering verification
  - Session role information accuracy
