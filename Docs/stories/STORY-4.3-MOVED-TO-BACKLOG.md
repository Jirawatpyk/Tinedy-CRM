# Story 4.3: Moved to Product Backlog

**Date Moved**: 2025-09-30
**Moved By**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**Reason**: Scrum Master review recommendation

---

## üìã Summary

**Story 4.3: Basic In-App Notification System** has been **moved out of Epic 4** to the Product Backlog.

---

## üéØ Reason for Moving

### Scrum Master (Bob) Review Findings:

1. **Wrong Epic Alignment**:
   - Epic 4 focuses on **Automation & Integration** (N8N webhook)
   - Story 4.3 is a **User Experience Enhancement** (Notifications)
   - Does not contribute to Epic 4's core goal

2. **Low Priority for Epic 4**:
   - **Story 4.1** (N8N Webhook): üî¥ Critical - MUST HAVE
   - **Story 4.2** (Monitoring): üü° Medium - SHOULD HAVE
   - **Story 4.3** (Notifications): üü¢ Low - NICE TO HAVE ‚Üê Not essential for Epic 4

3. **Low ROI Analysis**:
   - **Effort**: 3 days (Notification model + API + UI)
   - **Value**: Low - Operations can work without in-app notifications
   - **Alternative**: Operations manually refresh dashboard (acceptable short-term)

4. **Better Placement**:
   - Should be in **Epic 5** (UX Enhancements) or standalone backlog item
   - Can be implemented after Epic 4 core features are complete

---

## ‚úÖ Revised Epic 4 Scope

**Epic 4 now contains:**
- ‚úÖ Story 4.1: N8N Webhook Integration (7-8 days)
- ‚úÖ Story 4.2: Integration Monitoring Dashboard (3-4 days)

**Total**: 10-12 days (2-3 weeks)

**Removed from Epic 4:**
- ‚ùå Story 4.3: Basic Notification System ‚Üí **Product Backlog**

---

## üìÇ Original Story Location

**Original File**: `docs/stories/4.3.basic-notification-system.md`
**New Status**: **Backlog Item** (to be prioritized in future sprint)

---

## üìÖ Future Planning

**Story 4.3 can be considered for:**
1. **Epic 5**: Specialized Workflows & Mobile UI (UX enhancements fit better here)
2. **Standalone Sprint**: After Epic 4 completion, if time permits
3. **Future Enhancement**: When notification system becomes higher priority

---

## üìä Benefits of Moving Story 4.3

1. ‚úÖ **Focus**: Epic 4 stays focused on Automation & Integration
2. ‚úÖ **Reduced Complexity**: Sprint planning easier with 2 stories instead of 3
3. ‚úÖ **Lower Risk**: Less chance of not completing Epic 4 on time
4. ‚úÖ **Better Organization**: UX features grouped together in Epic 5
