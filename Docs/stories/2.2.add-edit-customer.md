# Story 2.2: Add/Edit Customer

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As an** Admin,
**I want** to add new customers to the system and edit existing customer information,
**so that** I can maintain accurate and up-to-date customer records.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A customer creation form is accessible from the customers list page.
2. The form includes fields for customer name, phone number, address, and contact channel.
3. The system validates that phone numbers are unique across all customers.
4. Upon successful creation, the user is redirected back to the customer list with the new customer visible.
5. Existing customers can be edited by clicking on their row or an "Edit" button.
6. All form fields should have proper validation and error messaging.
7. The system should handle both create and edit operations through the same form component.
