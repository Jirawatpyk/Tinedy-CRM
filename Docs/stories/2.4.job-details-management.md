- Clean separation between API routes and service layer
- Consistent error handling patterns

**API Standards**: ✅ PASS
- RESTful endpoint design (GET, PATCH)
- Consistent JSON response format

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Implementation Risks Identified**: 2 (both mitigated)

1. **Page Reload on Updates** (MEDIUM → LOW)
   - **Issue**: `window.location.reload()` used in all update operations
   - **Impact**: Causes full page reload, potential data loss if other unsaved changes
   - **Mitigation**: Auto-save in notes editor prevents data loss
   - **Recommendation**: Consider using Next.js router.refresh() for more efficient updates
   - **Status**: ACCEPTABLE for MVP, improve in future iteration

2. **API Field Name Compatibility** (LOW → RESOLVED)
   - **Issue**: Supporting both `assignedUserId` and `assignedToId`
   - **Impact**: Could cause confusion in codebase
   - **Mitigation**: API layer handles both field names transparently
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize on one field name in future
   - **Status**: PROPERLY HANDLED

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW ✅

### Files Modified During Review

No refactoring performed - code quality is excellent as-is.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS - No coding standards document found, but code follows React/Next.js best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS - Follows established patterns from previous stories
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ PASS - Comprehensive multi-level testing
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ PASS - 100% acceptance criteria coverage

### Improvements Checklist

Implementation is excellent. Optional future enhancements:

- [ ] Consider using router.refresh() instead of window.location.reload() for better UX
- [ ] Add E2E tests using Playwright for complete user journey validation
- [ ] Consider extracting confirmation dialog logic to a shared hook
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates without page reload
- [ ] Standardize on single field name (assignedUserId vs assignedToId)
