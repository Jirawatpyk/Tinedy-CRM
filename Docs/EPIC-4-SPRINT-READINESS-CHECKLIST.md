### 8. Risk Mitigation

#### High Priority Risks
1. **N8N Dependency** (P0)
   - Risk: Webhook format not confirmed → Sprint blocked
   - Mitigation: Start N8N coordination NOW
   - Fallback: Use mock endpoint, deploy later
   - Owner: Sarah (PO)

2. **Performance Target** (P1)
   - Risk: P95 response time > 500ms → AC12 failed
   - Mitigation: Load testing in staging before production
   - Fallback: Optimize database queries, add caching
   - Owner: Performance Engineer agent

3. **API Key Security** (P1)
   - Risk: API Key leaked → Security breach
   - Mitigation: Store in environment variables only
   - Fallback: Rotate API Key immediately
   - Owner: Auth-Security Specialist

#### Medium Priority Risks
4. **Testing Time Underestimated** (P2)
   - Risk: 2 days insufficient for 35+ tests
   - Mitigation: Start test scaffolding early
   - Fallback: Extend sprint by 1 day
   - Owner: Testing Specialist

5. **Database Migration Conflicts** (P2)
   - Risk: WebhookLog migration conflicts with other changes
   - Mitigation: Create migration early, test on staging
   - Fallback: Manual schema reconciliation
   - Owner: Database Architect
