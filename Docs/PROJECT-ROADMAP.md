## 🔴 ~~Epic 3: Admin Job Booking Management~~ (DEPRECATED)

**Status**: 🔴 **DEPRECATED**
**Date Deprecated**: 2025-09-30
**Reason**: 98.3% overlap with Epic 2

### Why Deprecated?

Epic 3 was found to have **98.3% overlap** with Epic 2 stories:
- Story 3.1 (Job Dashboard) = Story 2.4 ✅
- Story 3.2 (Manual Job Creation) = Story 2.3 ✅
- Story 3.3 (Job Details Management) = Story 2.4 ✅
- Story 3.4 (Assignment System) = Stories 2.3, 2.4 ✅
- Story 3.5 (N8N Integration) = Epic 4 Story 4.1 ✅
- Story 3.6 (Job Status Workflow) = Story 2.6 ✅

**Epic 2 provides superior coverage**:
- ✅ All Epic 3 features included
- ✅ Additional features: Delete operations (2.7, 2.9), User management (2.8)
- ✅ Enhanced UX/UI patterns with accessibility compliance
- ✅ Quality control checklist (2.5) - beyond Epic 3 scope

**Time Saved**: 4-6 weeks ⚡
